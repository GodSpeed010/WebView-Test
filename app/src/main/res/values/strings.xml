    <string name="long_text">Pretty good, the Toolbar is moving along with the list and getting back just as we expect it to. This is thanks to the restrictions that we put on the mToolbarOffset variable.
        If we would omit checking if it’s bigger than 0 and lower than mToolbarHeight then when
        we would scroll
         up our list, the Toolbar would move along far away off the screen, so to show it back you
         would have to scroll the list down to 0. Right now it just scrolls up to mToolbarHeight
         position and not more so it’s “sitting” right above the list all of the time and if we
         start scrolling down, we can see it immediately showing.

        It works pretty well, but this is not what we want. It feels weird that you can
        stop it in the middle of
        the

         scroll and the Toolbar will stay half visible. Actually this is how it’s done in Google Play
         Games app
        which I consider as a bug
